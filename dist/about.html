            <p>
              Greetings! I am an Irish software engineer and technical leader with over fifteen years experience in
              mobile, web, backend and embedded technologies, currently living in Barcelona. I started at the bottom of
              the stack, writing debug development tools for the Symbian operating system. This included standalone
              tools, user space tools and kernel instrumentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              After working on C++ point cloud analysis libraries for a while I decided to return to the world of mobile
              to check out the Android eco system, which has been my primary focus since 2011. Since then I have worked
              on a range of applications, from simple agenda style apps to full server driver widget engines to VOIP
              apps. I have also done the backend for some of these apps, using NodeJS, Postgres, MongoDB among others.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the last few years, in addition to development, I have worked as the technical lead of an
              interdisciplinary team - web, mobile and backend. This has been a great experience - challenging but very
              rewarding. I have always been interested in the methodology that drives great software teams, both
              technical and organisational. I believe strongly in teams over rockstars and in providing the minimal
              amount of process required to drive a teams maximum stable velocity. Strategies like CI/CD and automated
              testing are very important to achieve these goals.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
            Outside of the technologies that I work on directly day to day, I am also interested in data science,
            machine learning and cryptocurrency. And outside of technology, I have two great kids and a fantastic wife
            and am enjoying life in Barcelona!
          </p> -->
